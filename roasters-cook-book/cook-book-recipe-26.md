## Soup Holding and Serving Instructions

* Make sure there's about ½" of hot water in the warmer (take from brewer tap if you need to refill). Check periodically throughout the day, water will evaporate because it's kept hot all day long.

* To heat up cold soup, set the dial to 5 or 6. Check temp every 20 min, once it gets to 130* turn it down to 3. Hold at 3.

* Don't serve soup until it reaches 130*. At 180* cream soups will break, just like over steaming milk. Do not allow the temp to get close to 180*. Ideal holding temp is 140*-160* (just like steaming milk)

* Dangerous bacteria can grow at room temperature. We need to spend the least amount of time between the temps of 41*-130*. That's why you heat it up on #6, and why we use the ice paddle to cool it quickly at night.

* Using the ice paddle—Turn off the soup at night, remove from the warmer, remove the lid and submerge the ice paddle. Move it to the fridge ASAP and leave it un-covered until it gets below 41*. Set a timer and check fridge temp every 20 minutes to make sure the fridge is staying below 41*. Soup must be brought down to 40* within 2 hours.

* The ice paddle needs to be cleaned every morning and refilled with water (fill to fill line, not to top) and re-frozen ASAP so it's ready for the evening.
