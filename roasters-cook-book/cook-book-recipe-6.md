**The Kati Method** Starts by walking in the back door and turning on the light:

- → As you walk in, grab the cutting board from the triple sink and walk it into the kitchen and install onto the low boy.
- → Pull the two butters out and set on the shelf to come to room temp.
- → Grab a soup bowl and fill with water. Fill the soup well with approximately that much (if there is leftover, roughly accounting for volume), turn the dial to ten.
- → Take the soup bain out of the low boy (or prep from the back if it was pulled from the freezer)
