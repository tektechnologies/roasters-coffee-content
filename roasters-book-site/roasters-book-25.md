# COLD BREW INSTRUCTIONS

- To brew cold brew you will need: The green plug, the fabric filter, a paper filter, the 2 parts of the filter.

- Stick the plug in the bottom FROM THE OUTSIDE of the brewer.

- Stick the filter, fabric then paper filter on top of the plug inside the brewer.

- Rinse the cloth filter, it should be wet when you put it in.

- Pour grounds into paper filter, then make sure to shake the bag.

- Grind 4 LB or 72 OZ of espresso on ESPRESSO grind into a paper bag.

- Insert the paper filter on top of the fabric filter.

- Plug, with the handle facing up so it can be removed later.

- Now it's time to use the top piece of the filter.

- center hole with one finger and fill with cold water.

- Remove your finger and allow the stream of water to soak the grounds at first. 20 hours. (Easy way to figure out)

- Wine the drain time on the outside of the Filtron with a paint marker or on a post it.

- the reason I say one finger is to allow water to drip out the bottom and not spray all over you.

- Now it's time to use the top piece of the filter, center hole with one finger and fill with cold water 3/4 LB fill line.

- Saturate with water until water just gets to the top of the coffee.

- strong enough and we're just washing that coffee out—subtract 4 hours from the time you brew it)
